# FinTech-Case-Study-Trulioo
*Unit 1, RegTech Domain*


## Overview and Origin

* Trulioo 

* Trulioo was incorporated on January 1st, 2011.

* Stephen Ufford and Tanis Jorge are the founders of the company.

* Stephen and Tanis came up with the idea while watching a CNN segment that showed the impact of a woman from India seeing her Facebook profile for the first time. They then realized how many people across the world had no cyber identity or real record of their existence.

* Trulioo has received $96.6 million in funding (as of May 6th, 2021). They have raised this money through investors, including the likes of Goldman Sachs Growth Equity, American Express Ventures and Citi Ventures. They also have paired with American Express to offer three months of free service to businesses around the world.


## Business Activities

* One main financial problem that Trulioo is combating would be financial inclusion. The founders noticed a plethora of people around the world; specifically in more impoverished countries and locations that did not have cyber identites. In order to improve trust between seller and buyer they needed a way to make sure that the people buying the products or receiving services were real. With the increase in online sales and services, and a lack of cyber identity in less fortunate countries, there was a major disconnect in supplying the products and services with trust to these countries. Two key factors in this problem would be customer due dilligence (CDD), and fraud protection. The success of these key factors hinges on identity verification, which is what Trulioo specifies in. Effective identity proofing procedures are necessary to meeting Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer (AML/KYC) requirements.

* The market size of Trulioo seems to be endless. It was developed for the international market, and pertains to anyone making any kind of purchase online, which is also their intended customer. It also goes further than just users making a purchase. Anyone using Google Maps or Waze is verified using Trulioo as well. More specifically, they want to make their services available to less fortunate people, and have a great support system and affordable plans to do so. In pairing with American Express Ventures, they are able to offer three months of free services which sets them apart from their competitors. 

* Trulioo utilizes the use of many different technologies to set their company apart from their competitors. To communicate instructions to computers, Trulioo uses the programming languages Java, C#, and Scala. They also use PHP and JavaScript scripting languages to automate the execution of operations in a runtime environment. To improve their online security and performance, they use Cloudfare and Incapsula. Some other applications and softwares they use consist of NGINX, an open source software used for web serving, caching, media streaming, and more; and Bootstrap for app and web development. They also use Shell, which is a computer program that presents a command line interface that allows you to control your computer using commands entered with a keyboard. They use jQuery as a functions library for their web developers. Some utilities that Trulioo also uses for web analytics are Piwik and Google Analytics. Piwik is a web analytics application that uses a tracking code to collect data about people who visit the intended website or application. They also use Google Analytics, which includes features that can help identify trends and patterns in how visitors engage with their websites and applications. On top of all of these technologies, Trulioo uses a variety of different business tools to help further improve productivity, efficiency, and much more. Examples of these business tools are WordPress, G Suite, Marketo, FreshDesk, AdRoll, HubSpot, and Google Fonts. 


## Landscape

* Trulioo falls under the the Regulatory Tech Industry. RegTech is an emerging application area that uses digital technology to make regulatory reporting, management and compliance easier. It offers a number of advantages including: it increases efficiency of operational processes; reduces risk; reduces costs and improves revenue.

* Regtech has become critical for financial institutions as they continue to battle the complex and costly financial regulations. Recently, Regtech companies have been receiving huge investments because the demand for more efficient technology and solutions have increased so drastically. One element in the regtech industry that has already become exceedingly important and will continue to grow further in 2022 is outsourcing reporting. As regulatory requirements have increased, there are technology requirements that can address multiple regulations which increase the return on investment. There is also a significant requirement to improve the quality of data reported across various jurisdictions, especially EMIR Reporting, SMCR, and Operational Resilience. Because of the tightening of regulations, balancing privacy with surveillance has also become exceedingly important. When it comes to data processing, storage, and investigation, firms will need to tread a very thin line between business requirements and privacy. This is specifically tough on risk-management, trading, and research desks because they rely on personal relationships, where shared personal information and business are both in the conversation. This should also show more room for behavioral based AI platforms that analyze each communication and focus only on the important date. Another change that has already begun and will continue to improve is Anti Money-Laundering controls in reference to cryptocurrency firms. Closely tied to artificial intelligence, investments in machine learning will also rise as the market matures throughout 2022. AI and ML usage reduces the costs and increases efficiency in almost every aspect of a business, especially when it comes to assuring regulatory compliance which reduces the resources necessary in the analytics of data and increases speed. 

* There are five main branches under the RegTech domain; regulatory reporting, risk management, identity management and control, compliance, and transaction monitoring. Trulioo falls under the identity management and control branch, and has a variety of intense competition keeping them on their toes. Their top competitors in the identity verification field are Lightico, Jumio Identity Verification, IntSig OCR Solutions, and Onfido. The top competitors in terms of E-Commerce Fraud Protection are Signifyd, Riskified, Pipl (identity verification and fraud protection), and ClearSale.
