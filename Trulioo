# Fintech Case Study

## Overview and Origin

* Trulioo 

* Trulioo was incorporated on January 1st, 2011.

* Stephen Ufford and Tanis Jorge are the founders of the company.

* Stephen and Tanis came up with the idea while watching a CNN segment that showed the impact of a woman from India seeing her Facebook profile for the first time. They then realized how many people across the world had no cyber identity or real record of their existence.

* Trulioo has received $96.6 million in funding (as of May 6th, 2021). They have raised this money through investors, including the likes of Goldman Sachs Growth Equity, American Express Ventures and Citi Ventures. They also have paired with American Express to offer three months of free service to businesses around the world.


## Business Activities

* The main financial problem that Trulioo is combating would be financial inclusion. The founders noticed a plethora of people around the world; specifically in more impoverished countries and locations that did not have cyber identites. In order to improve trust between seller and buyer they needed a way to make sure that the people buying the products or receiving services were real. With the increase in online sales and services, and a lack of cyber identity in less fortunate countries, there was a major disconnect in supplying the products and services with trust to these countries. Two key factors in this problem would be customer due dilligence (CDD), and fraud protection. The success of these key factors hinges on identity verification, which is what Trulioo specifies in. 

* The market size of Trulioo seems to be endless. It was developed for the international market, and pertains to anyone making any kind of purchase online, which is also their intended customer. It also goes further than just users making a purchase. Anyone using Google Maps or Waze is verified using Trulioo as well. More specifically, they want to make their services available to less fortunate people, and have a great support system and affordable plans to do so. In pairing with American Express Ventures, they are able to offer three months of free services which sets them apart from their competitors. 

* Trulioo uses many different technologies to mitigate the problems they face.
